I am a Research Scientist at [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu/),  working on Conversational AI systems. My current research interests are at the intersection of Human-AI Interaction, Conversational AI, VR/AR/MR and, Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning. I earned my Ph.D. in Robotics from Georgia Tech.

Previously, I was a Robotics Technical Fellow in the [Advanced Technology Group](https://about.ups.com/us/en/our-stories/innovation-driven/atg-test-labs.html) at UPS where I conducted research on the applications of robotics and automation across various business units and led strategic initiatives and roadmaps for various robotics projects for UPS R&D, including robotics simulation (digital twin), automated truck loading and unloading systems and humanoid robots. I also spent time at [The Ohio State University](https://www.osu.edu/) working on 'robots in the wild' project. 

My latest CV is available upon request.
