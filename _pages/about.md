I am a Research Scientist at the [AI Hub](https://www.gatech.edu/news/2023/06/06/ai-hub-georgia-tech-unite-campus-artificial-intelligence-rd-and-commercialization) at [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu/). My current research interests are at the intersection of Human-AI Interaction, Conversational AI, VR/AR/MR and, Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning. I earned my Ph.D. in Robotics from Georgia Tech.

Previously, I was a Robotics Technical Fellow in the [Advanced Technology Group](https://about.ups.com/us/en/our-stories/innovation-driven/atg-test-labs.html) at UPS where I conducted research on the applications of robotics and automation across various business units of the logistics and supply chain industry. Additionally, I led strategic initiatives and roadmaps for multiple robotics projects for UPS R&D, including robotics digital twin/simulation, automated truck loading and unloading systems and humanoid robots.
