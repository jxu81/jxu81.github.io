Trust is essential for successful human-robot interaction. When robots are in human environments, establishing a trusting relationship is crucial {%cite xu2018overtrust%}. This project focuses on understanding human-robot trust in time-sensitive scenarios where a robot or AI agent provides advice. The goal is to develop algorithms that infer human trust from prior interactions and mitigate negative outcomes when trust is violated.

Key aspects of the project include:

- Investigating trust between humans and interactive robots during cognitive problem-solving {%cite xu2018impact xu2018investigating%} and simulated driving scenarios {%cite xu2020much%}.
- Developing a realistic VR driving scenario based on the Georgia Tech campus {%cite xu2020much %}.
- Creating a computational framework to model human-robot trust in these scenarios {%cite xu2020would%}.
- Developing trust repair strategies to restore broken trust and mitigate potential negative outcomes{%cite xu2022evaluating%}.
