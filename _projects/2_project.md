Project THRIVE (**T**herapeutic **H**umanoid **R**obot **I**n **V**irtual **E**nvironment) aims to develop and study the use of a robot assisted rehabilitation system on the arm function of children with cerebral palsy. This combination of a motivational humanoid robot and a virtual reality computer game provides a fun and motivating way for children with cerebral palsy to engage in exercise at home. This project was founded by the National Institute on Disability, Independent Living, and Rehabilitation Research (NIDILRR), and is an active research collaboration between the Ohio State University and Georgia State Univerity.
